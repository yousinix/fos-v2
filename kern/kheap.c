// krealloc():

//	Attempts to resize the allocated space at "virtual_address" to "new_size" bytes,
//	possibly moving it in the heap.
//	If successful, returns the new virtual_address, in which case the old virtual_address must no longer be accessed.
//	On failure, returns a null pointer, and the old virtual_address remains valid.

//	A call with virtual_address = null is equivalent to kmalloc().
//	A call with new_size = zero is equivalent to kfree().
